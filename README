you should have a reputation score or renown score
for different things
eg. magic, fighting
which will grow on the the acheivements of the town
the buildings 
and the people that live in the town

so if you have loads of libraries and wizards
you attract more powerful wizards
if you have a gladiator areana
you attract fighters
which might be good or bad for the town

ahh.. this could be really cool
okay, so everything generates a score
and then depending on how those scores add up, it will geneerate events
for example, having a tavern will add +10 to happiness of the town
+10 to disorder
+10 wealth 
okay, and then something like a jail will add -10 to disorder
+10 to some other stat
all these will add up
and you will get a score for you town

depending on the score
events happen which can be programmed in
i.e. bandits coming
fights int he street

then some things should be modifiers
i.e. co-efficeints 
so if you have a laboratory focused on agriculture
you get to times your food store by 1.3x
you can build another laboratory, or inspire technicians to come work 
and then you get to improve the modifier
also, if you attract enough of one type of person
aka fighters - barbarians/paladins/etc.
or magicians/wizards/sourcerers
rougues/theives/ etc
you can generate a guild
this will naturally open up side quests
like if you get enough assasins

you create a guild called-- hmm.. i don't know - lets call it the dark brotherhood
and they will only come if you end up killing an innocent person
and they'll come in the dead of night
